<p><h3>  Focused attention </h3>
Attention, also referred to as enthrallment, is the behavioral and cognitive process of selectively concentrating on a discrete aspect of information, whether deemed subjective or objective, while ignoring other perceivable information. It is a state of arousal.
It is the taking possession by the mind in clear and vivid form of one out of what seem several simultaneous objects or trains of thought.
