  <p><h3>AFFECTION이란 무엇인가?</h3>
    Affection is a "disposition or state of mind or body" that is often associated with
    a feeling or type of love.  "Affection" is popularly used to denote a feeling or type of love,
    amounting to more than goodwill or friendship.
    Even a very simple demonstration of affection can have a broad variety of emotional reactions,
    from embarrassment to disgust to pleasure and annoyance. It also has a different physical effect
    on the giver and the receiver.
    More specifically, the word has been restricted to emotional states, the object of which
    is a living thing such as a human or animal. Affection is compared with passion, from the Greek "pathos".
